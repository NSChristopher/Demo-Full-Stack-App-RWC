# Issue: MVP - Minimal Viable Product for Beauty Shop Web App

## Title
MVP: Customer Browsing, Cart, and Admin Product Management

### Description
This issue covers the core features required to launch a minimal, usable version of the Beauty Shop web app. Customers must be able to browse products by category, search for products, add items to their cart, and complete a secure checkout. Admins must be able to add, edit, and remove products from the catalog. This MVP will provide the foundation for future enhancements such as order history and advanced admin features.

**Narrative Example:**
Sarah is a new customer looking for skincare products. She visits the site, browses by category, searches for a specific moisturizer, adds it to her cart, and checks out securely. Meanwhile, the shop owner logs in to the admin dashboard to add a new product and update stock for an existing item. This flow demonstrates the essential value of the MVP for both customers and admins.

## Guidlines for saving Documentation
_*This should be pressent and unchanged in all issues*_

Where Should Documentation Be Saved?
- **New Features**: If a new feature is created, document the feature in a Markdown file and save it inside the `documentation/docs` folder. The file name should be descriptive of the feature (e.g., `feature-name.md`).
- **Edited Features**: If an existing feature is edited, locate the corresponding Markdown file in the `documentation/docs` folder and update it with the changes.

Steps for Committing Changes and Creating a Pull Request

1. **Navigate to the External Docs Repository**:
   - Ensure you are working within the `documentation` repository.
   - cd into the nested repository:
     ```bash
     cd documentation
     ```

2. **Add or Edit Documentation**:
   - For new features:
     - Create a new Markdown file in the `documentation/docs` folder.
     - Write detailed documentation about the feature, including its purpose, functionality, and usage instructions.
   - For edited features:
     - Locate the existing Markdown file in the `documentation/docs` folder.
     - Update the file with the relevant changes.

3. **Stage the Changes**:
   - Run the following command to stage the changes:
     ```bash
     git add docs/
     ```

4. **Commit the Changes**:
   - Use a descriptive commit message to explain the changes:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Add/Edit documentation for [feature-name]"
     ```

4. **Push the Changes to a New Branch**:
   - Create a new branch for the changes:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature-doc-update
     ```
   - Push the branch to the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push -u origin feature-doc-update
     ```

## Notes
- Ensure all documentation is clear, concise, and follows the formatting guidelines of the repository.
